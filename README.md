Project Description:
The aim of this project is to familiarize ourselves with industry-standard software development tools such as Git and Trello. To that end, we have picked one of the Tensorflow Models (namignizer) to modify.
Download the enviroment for git (We are all using Windows machines, so we downloaded Git Bash), download and install the environment for TensorFlow.
Learn about github's features and web settings.
Run through basic git tutorial to understand how to use git.
Learn how to Tensorflow works.
Pick a model - We chose namignizer.
Modify Namignizer to have some updated outputs.
Software Setup:
Install Python 3 - Downloads can be found here.
Install Tensorflow - The easiest way to install it is to use pip (pip install tensorflow).
Clone this repository.
Run names.py (python names.py).
If you wish to run the model with a different dataset, just replace the contents in data/SmallNames.txt OR create a new textfile in /data/ and update names.py to look for the new file instead.
Screenshots:
Run original SmallNames.txt :

Learning rate was changed, resulted in decreased running time and varied result perplexity.
