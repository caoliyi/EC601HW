1. Download the enviroment for git (We are all using Windows machines, so we downloaded Git Bash), download and install the environment for TensorFlow.
2. Learn about github's features and web settings.
3. Run through basic git tutorial to understand how to use git.
4. Learn how to Tensorflow works.
5. Pick a model - We chose namignizer.
6. Modify Namignizer to have some updated outputs.
